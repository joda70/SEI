# SMDA (Software Metrics Data Analysis)

This repository aims at providing some csv datatasets that contain measurements of software metrics to be used for addressing some software engineering issues such as quality prediction. 

The datasets derive from the NASA defect datasets, that have been backup by [Dr Chakkrit (Kla) Tantithamthavorn](
https://github.com/klainfo/NASADefectDataset) and converted from ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) to the CSV (comma-separated values) format when necessary by using .

The original datasets have been cleaned according to Shepperd, M. et al., Data Quality: Some Comments on the NASA Software Defect Datasets, IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering, 2013.
